# LAB | Canvas Race Car

## Introduction

We are ready to start making some games with `canvas` help, so in this first exercise, we will a **Car Race** using some basic animations we learned today.

Remember, you have the Learning Units to check any concept you might need. We are working with the `2D` context, so you should think the canvas is a cartesian plane, where you can move elements changing their position in any of the `axis`.

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo

## Submission

- Upon completion, run the following commands:

  ```
  git add .
  git commit -m "done"
  git push origin master
  ```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1: Draw the game board

The first thing we need is to create our board. The left side of the image is already on the HTML file, but when we click on the **Start Game** button, we need to create the canvas and display the road.

The canvas HTML element is already part of the HTML starter code provided in the `index.html` file. In the `images` folder, you can find the image of the road.

The *intrisic* dimensions of the `<canvas>` **should be 1000x1600**

You should add your drawing instructions inside the `js/main.js` `function draw() {}`.

### Iteration 2: Draw the car

Once we have our road, we need the player's car. The same as for the raod, in the `images` folder, you will find a `.png` file you should use.

You should use the `Car` class:
- in the constructor, once image is loaded, assign `this.w`, `this.h`, `this.x` and `this.y`:
- `this.w` should be 100 units as width
- `this.h` should be computed thanks to `imgRatio` and `this.w`
- Then implement the `draw()` method

Once our `Car` class is ready, in `js/main.js` don't forget to create a new car ðŸš— when `startGame()`! Don't also forget to draw it !

### Iteration 3: Make the car move right and left

In our game, the player will only be able to move the car to the right and left. Using `left` and `right` arrows, the player should be able to move the car.

For that you should implement the 2 methods `moveLeft()` and `moveRight` of the `Car` class.

NB: Use `document.onkeydown = function (e) {...}` already defined in `js/main.js` to detect the key pressed.

:bulb: Remember the boundaries!

### Iteration 4: Create obstacles

Now let's make this interesting. We should create obstacles that show up every specific amount of time.

They will always start in the position **0** of the `y` axis (the obstacles will be coming from the top of the canvas), but you should make them appear in a random place of the `x` axis.

You should use the `Obstacle` class:
- in the `constructor()`, assign `this.w`, `this.h`, `this.x` and `this.h`
- then implement the `draw()` method

NB: Implement a utility `random(from, to)` function, to help you get random numbers for your obstacles.

NB: For moving the obstacles, we need to update our `canvas` continuously. In this iteration, you need to continually change the position of the obstacles in every update, making them move down the road.

### Iteration 5: Collisions

Implement the `hits()` method into `Obstacle` class:
- it takes the car as parameter
- it should return a boolean wether the obstacle hits the car (or not).

NB: car hits an obstacle when car is in-between obstacle horizontally and vertically :)

Once `hits()` implemented, test it against each obstacle in `js/main.js`.

If one hits the car, pass `gameover` to `true` so it won't call `requestAnimationFrame` next frame, ie: stop the gameloop.

### Iteration 6: Points, points, points

Oh! If we want to challenge somebody, we need to quantify who is making it better. So we need to add a **score**. Go ahead and add a method to count points while you keep the car avoiding obstacles.
